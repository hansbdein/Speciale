# [PArthENoPE](http://parthenope.na.infn.it/)
Public Algorithm Evaluating the Nucleosynthesis of Primordial Elements

PArthENoPE is a Fortran code for computing the evolution of abundances
of light nuclei during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
It also comes with a graphical user interface (GUI), written in python,
to simply the creation of input cards, running the code and producing
plots with the obtained outputs.

# CONTENT OF THE PACKAGE

PArthENoPE3.0 package consists of the following files:

* a file `README.md` (this file) listing the content of the package and brief 
instructions on how to proceed.

* two FORTRAN files containing the main interface and program: `parthenope3.0.f` 
and `main3.0.f`.

* four additional FORTRAN files containing the routines used by the main program: 
`addon3.0.f`, `dlsode.f`, `odepack1-parthenope3.0.f`, `odepack2-parthenope3.0.f`.

* a `Makefile` with some useful commands to compile the code, install the GUI
and launch some tests.

* an example configuration file `input3.0.card` (for compatibility reasons with
the previous version and to be used as input sample for testing the fortran code).

* a file `rates.dat` for choosing the main rates for deuterium production.

* sample output files, `parthenope3.0.out` and `nuclides3.0.out`, obtained when the
fortran code runs with the default parameters contained in `input3.0.card`.

* a number of Python files, the main executable `gui3.0.py` and the package
`parthenopegui/`, containing the code for running the GUI.

* two python utilities, `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`, to install the GUI dependencies.

* a script to facilitate the installation of the GUI within Anaconda environments,
`conda.sh`.

* a file `changelog3.0.txt` listing the changes with respect to the past versions.


# USE OF PARTHENOPE (in a nutshell)

If you want to use the standard version of PArthENoPE3.0:

1) Compile the FORTRAN source files using the `make` command. By default, the
Makefile is configured to use the `gfortran` compiler. If you have a different
one, you should either edit the `F90` option in the Makefile to indicate your
preference (recommended), or compile with `make F90=...`, where the name of your 
preferred compiler should replace the `...`. Notice, however, that the latter way 
does not allow the GUI to compile the executable, if it is missing. A modification 
of the `Makefile` is also required if the standard Fortran libraries are not 
available in the default paths: in such case, the user must edit the `FLIBS` 
variable appropriately.

2) Call the executable, `parthenope3.0` (interactive or card mode).

For installing and using the GUI:

1A) If you do not use Anaconda, you should be able to install the required python
dependencies with `make installguiuser` (recommended) or `make installgui` (within 
a virtual environment or in other cases). Add `sudo` in case superuser privileges 
are required. By default, the system `python` will be used. If you want to use a 
different python version, you should change the `PY` variable in the Makefile 
(recommended), or add `PY=...` to the previous commands, for example use `make 
installguiuser PY=python3` to install locally with `python3`.

1B) If you use Anaconda, we are aware of an incompatibility between the PySide2
version installable through the python repositories and the Qt version within
Anaconda, therefore you must not use the `PyPI` repositories. You should use
`make installconda` instead, that will create a new environment named
`parthenope3.0` and install the required packages by means of the `conda`
utilities and repositories. You can actually select the name for the new
environment by specifying `make installconda CONDAENV=...`, where your environment
name substitutes the `...`. Remember to activate your environment (`conda activate
parthenope3.0` or with the environment name of your choice) any time you want to
use the GUI.

2) Launch the GUI with the command: `make rungui`, or `python gui3.0.py &`. If you 
used a custom python version in the previous step, it is automatically adopted if 
you modified the Makefile and use `make rungui`, otherwise you can use `make rungui 
F90=...`. Otherwise, you should execute `gui3.0.py` explicitely with the same 
python version used to install, for example `python3 gui3.0.py &`.
