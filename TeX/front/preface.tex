\begin{multiabstract}{Acknowledgements} 
\noindent First and foremost, I would like to thank my friends and family for supporting and believing in me throughout the entirety of my time at IFA. For this thesis, I would like to thank my supervisor Thomas Tram, and unofficial co-supervisor Steen Hannested, for helping me along the way and ensuring I reached the goal in the end. I would also like to thank Erik Steenberg, Camilla SÃ¸rensen, Emil Birk, and Marta Jensen for proofreading the first and second draft of this thesis. In addition, I want to thank all the people at 1520-823, and in particular Christiane Rahbek, for providing company during the long days and nights of writing this thesis. I would also like to thank the pynucastro team for being very helpful in quickly fixing bugs and adding necessary features, with special thanks to Michael Zingale. 

Finally, I would like to thank my grandfather for igniting the passion for science, which has led me to this moment.
